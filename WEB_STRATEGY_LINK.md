# NUANCE WEB - STRATEGY LINK

> **IMPORTANT:** This folder (`nuance-web`) is the current **EXECUTION CORE** of the Nuance Strategy.

## Context
We are implementing the **"Web-First MVP"** strategy (v1.4).
Instead of struggling with Obsidian's API constraints, we are building a high-performance **Standalone Web Engine** here.

## Goal
Build a handwriting experience that feels "Better than Paper". Focus on:
1.  **Physics:** Ink viscosity, velocity response.
2.  **Sound:** Real-time ASMR.
3.  **Low Latency:** Optimized Canvas rendering.

**DO NOT** add complex note-taking features (Folders, Tags) yet. Focus 100% on the **WRITING FEEL**.
