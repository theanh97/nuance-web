# Nuance Breakthroughs: Future Concepts

## 1. The "Digital Friction" Paradox (Ma Sát Kỹ Thuật Số)
**Discovery (2026-01-28)**: Users reports Nuance feels *better* than Samsung Notes when using a slippery (hard) nib.
**Why?**
*   **Physical Reality**: Hard Nib + Glass Screen = Slippery (Low Friction). Control is difficult.
*   **Samsung Approach**: Relies on hardware (Soft Nibs) for friction. When that fails, the software feels "loose".
*   **Nuance Approach**: We use **Sensory Substitution**.
    *   **Visual Drag**: Our "Alive Ink" has a micro-delay (fluid simulation) that the brain interprets as "resistance".
    *   **Acoustic Texture**: The "Scratch" sound convinces the brain there is texture, even if the glass is smooth.

**Conclusion**: We can make cheap/slippery hardware feel "Premium" purely through software.

## 2. Dynamic "Nib Profiles"
Instead of just "Pen" and "Marker", we introduce **Hardware Calibration**:
*   **My Nib is**: [ Slippery / Hard ] vs [ Grippy / Soft ].
*   **Action**: 
    *   If **Slippery**: Increase Audio Volume (High Freq) + Increase Visual Streamline (Drag).
    *   If **Grippy**: Decrease Audio + Decrease Streamline (Raw input).
